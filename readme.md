# presence-only species distribution modelling review

After a discussion with a (non-ecologist) statistician colleague about ways of dealing with presence-only data I sent him an overly-long email detailing the interesting recent developments in presence-only species distribution modelling.
I thought it was quite a handy summary and might be the nugget of a review paper.
So I've stuck it up here in case anyone would like to correct/improve it or help work it into a paper.

Please feel free to hack at it and let me know whether you'd like to pitch in developing this into something.
